## ðŸš€ Overview

**Transpark** is a lightweight and extensible framework that helps you compose complex transformation pipelines and cache intermediate results in PySpark â€” declaratively and reproducibly.

It is especially useful for building **data pipelines**, **ETL flows**, and **intermediate result debugging**.

Except composable pattern it also provides useful operations like suffixed joins or customized window functions
